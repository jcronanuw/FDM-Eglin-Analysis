# Name: FUELBED DYNAMICS MODEL (FDM) -- Eglin Air Force Base Analysis   
# Purpose: Analyze output data from FDM v2.0 simulations of FCCS fuelbeds at
# Eglin Air Force Base and surrounding buffer area. 25 simulations will be run
# for 10-year average area-burned, average mechanical/chemical restoration
# treatments and 4 levels of prescribed fire: 
# 1) 125% of 10-year average (125k acres/year)
# 1) 100% of 10-year average (100k acres/year)
# 1) 75% of 10-year average (75k acres/year)
# 1) 50% of 10-year average (50k acres/year)
# FDM v2.0 simulation duration is 50 years.
